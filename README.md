# HelloNode
Test project for learning HTML, CSS, JS,Node.js and Mongo DB

## Instructions on how to clone repository

```
git clone git@github.com:AlmirDautovic/HelloNode.git
```
```
git add .
git commit -m "random message"
git push origin main
```

Create new branch, and push to new branch
```
git pull origin main
git checkout -b branch_name
```

Last cmd will create new branch, then you add commit and push to that branch, same as first set of commands, only difference will be git push origin branch_name instead of git push origin main.
