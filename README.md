# Gym App
This project (which is in progress) is my learning project where I want to implement knowledge I gained learning from tutorials and Udemy courses.
In this project I used HTML, CSS, JS,Node.js and Mongo DB. 

## About Project


Frontend:

```
On frontend side I used  HTML/CSS to apply basic UI design, adding templates for header and footer to every page.
JavaScript is used mainly to send asynchronus requests (GET,POST, PUT, DELETE) to server side endpoints, and dynamically manipulate DOM based on server response. This allowed user to save data, upload pictures and get content with or without refreshing page.


Backend:

```
On server side I used Node.js to handle request and send fitting responds. I added cookies and session menagement, pagination,that is good option for dealing with large amount of information from database. Implemented Login/logout options to provides basic authentication and control acces to certain endpoints.
Additionall control is provided with implementation of roles, such as Admin role, which helds most controll over aplication.

Database:

```
I used MongoDB to create models, store, delete, update and fetch requested data. Models are used separatelly and also in relations with another using population methods depending action and fequest from user side.
